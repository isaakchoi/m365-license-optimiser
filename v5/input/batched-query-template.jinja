Below is a list of multiple different groups of Microsoft 365 licenses that have been applied to users.

For each group of licenses, create a new object in the 'responses' array by doing the following:
- Populate the 'license_group' field with a list of all licenses in the license group currently being considered.
- Populate the 'overlapping_licenses' field with a list of the licenses from the license group that provide overlapping tools. Only include answers that you are sure about.
- Provide a detailed justification of your choices.

Think deeply about each answer, considering your knowledge of what tools each license provides and whether other licenses also provide the exact same tools.

``` Microsft 365 License Groups
{% for group in license_groups %} - {{ group | join(', ') }}
{% endfor -%}
```

Output your answer as valid JSON.
