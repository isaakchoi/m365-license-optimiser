Below is a list of multiple different groups of Microsoft 365 licenses that have been applied to users.

``` Microsft 365 License Groups
{% for group in license_groups %} - {{ group | join(', ') }}
{% endfor -%}
```

For each group of licenses, create a new object in the 'responses' array so that it aligns with the given schema. Think deeply about your answer, considering your knowledge of what features each license has and how they relate to other licenses. Strictly output your answer as valid JSON.

Follow the following instructions when populating each object:
1. Populate the 'license_group' field with a list of all licenses in the license group currently being considered.
2. Populate the 'overlapping_licenses' field with a list of all licenses in the license group that provide overlapping features. Provide a justification of your choices in the 'overlapping_licenses_justification' field.
